A maze that would find a path to which specific spot you want to go.

# Todo: (Maybe in the future)
1. Change the `Maze background` into `Cyan/Light shade of blue` as if it is in the `water`.


# Visualization:

A snake underwater finding its own path to a specified destination.

`LightSeaGreen boxes` = `Seaweeds` thats is blocking the path.

`Black boxes` = is the `snake`.

`White boxes` = is the `water environment`.
